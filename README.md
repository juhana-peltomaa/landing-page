# Landing Page

This project is completed as a part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) - you can find the full task description [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

The goal of this project is to revise basic HTML & CSS while creating a simple landing page

## Features

E.g. following elements were practiced in this project:
 - Creating a navbar (without using the <nav></nav> element)
 - Various flexbox alignment options
 - Combining various sections in a page etc.

 Note that this project is kept at barebones and e.g. did not consider any mobile optimisation nor images. These might be added later.
